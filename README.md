DEPLOYMENT OF THREE-TIER APPLICATION ON AWS 

The Project above deploys a three-tier application on AWS. The necessary network, security, app, and database components and configurations were manually created to run this architecture in an available and scalable manner.

Architecture Overview
![3TierArch](https://github.com/tobyoluyole/Deploying-three-tier-application-on-AWS-/assets/105201994/9abe8f47-901a-41e5-9bee-734c14911d3f)
The architecture above shows a public-facing Application Load Balancer that forwards client traffic to the web tier EC2 instances. The web tier is running Nginx web servers that are configured to serve a React.js website and redirect  API calls to the application tierâ€™s internal facing load balancer. The internal facing load balancer then forwards that traffic to the application tier written in Node.js. The application tier manipulates data in an Aurora MySQL multi-AZ database and returns it to the web tier. Load balancing, health checks and autoscaling groups are created at each layer to maintain the availability of this architecture.
